# Engineering Vazhikaatti

A Flutter project attempted to develop based on clean architecture concepts.


After working some time , Most of the developers feel that, The estimation capability to add new feature goes down, .

This is mainly due to two reason

   If its a backend all our logic are buried in service classes based on db design , rarely it will come out of it ( Thinking of Spring boot , Play framework Actors)
   
   If its frontend all our logic are buried on screens and if not it would be buried within these UI Screens ,or View Models ( Android Dev), Components or Services (Angular), Stores.


For me clean architecture helps  to  application to be more scalable for requirements, as every new requirement will be drafted as an usecase , not tightly coupled with screen or database


[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)



I tried to adapt it across and ends up something like this.
