# Engineering Vazhikaatti

A small app to priortize Engineering colleges in TNEA  2021 based on your cutoff and community against last three years data across TNEA affiliated engineering colleges.

And our Dev stuff

A Flutter project attempted to develop based on clean architecture concepts.

After working some time in any project be it mobile or web or front end or backend , Most developers feel , Their estimation capability to add new feature been dropping because of code getting rigid and unsure about what does what? .

I think is mainly due to two reason

   If its a backend,  Mostly the logic are buried in service classes based on table or an external service response , rarely it will come out of it ( Thinking of Spring boot , Play framework Actors)
   
   If its frontend all our logic are buried on screens and if not it would be buried within these UI Screens ,or View Models ( Android Dev), Components or Services (Angular), Stores.


I personally feel clean architecture helps  to address these kind of issues in long run , which will ensure to make our coding experience smoother after a very long time , not only for us, for those whom we bring into the project
  
As every new requirement will be drafted as an independent usecase , not tightly coupled with any screen or a table

For more details about Clean Architecture refer this [Clean Architecture By Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)


I tried to adapt it for my flutter  and ends up something like this.
